Alright. Here's my idea for partially flushing the translation buffer for
writable areas.

== Writable Areas ==

There are three writable areas in a Game Boy Advance's memory map, of which
only the first two are supported for containing code in current "master gpSP"
(as opposed to the experimental code), but a real Game Boy Advance would be
able to execute code from all of them:

* The Internal Working RAM (IWRAM), 32 KiB of memory close to the ARM7TDMI
  processor. This memory uses a 32-bit bus, so programmers are advised to
  put ARM code here.
* The External Working RAM (EWRAM), 256 KiB of memory that sits somewhat far
  from the processor. This memory uses a 16-bit bus, so programmers are
  advised to put Thumb code here.
* The Video RAM (VRAM), 96 KiB of memory that uses a 16-bit bus, some of
  which is unused for graphics depending on the Game Boy Advance's active
  video mode.

Of course, it is possible to place ARM code in EWRAM and VRAM (which would
then be fetched twice too slow), and Thumb code in IWRAM (which would be
prefetched two instructions at a time).

== ARM and Thumb code ==

ARM code is 4 bytes per instruction, and an ARM instruction must reside at
an address that is a multiple of 4 (4-byte-aligned).

Thumb code is 2 bytes per instruction, and a Thumb instruction must reside at
an address that is a multiple of 2 (2-byte-aligned).

ARM and Thumb code may freely be mixed in the same memory line, and a piece
of code may be both valid ARM and valid Thumb. A branch to an instruction that
is 4-byte-aligned, using the BX instruction, may branch to that instruction in
ARM mode if the address's bit 0 is clear, or in Thumb mode if its bit 0 is
set. A branch to an instruction that is 2-byte-aligned but not 4-byte-aligned
must be in Thumb mode, with the address's bit 0 set for the BX instruction.

== Abstract ==

To unify the implementation of block tags across all writable areas (and
unfortunately the BIOS, as it also uses a block tag mechanism), as well as
to allow this polyglot ARM-Thumb code to work properly, I wish to use tags
to indicate the native code addresses of both ARM and Thumb code.

The compiler will be retrofitted to issue a write into a new metadata area
separate from the 'iwram', 'ewram' and 'vram' variables, which I will
henceforth refer to as a Metadata Area (original, huh?). To refer to the area
which a Metadata Area describes with its tags, instead of writing
"'iwram', 'ewram' or 'vram'", I will use the generic term Data Area.

== The Metadata Area ==

For each 32-bit word in a Data Area (the Data Word), the corresponding
Metadata Area shall have four (4) 16-bit [half-]words (a Metadata Entry):

  [ data | data | data | data | data |...]
    ...is described by...
  (me ta da ta|me ta da ta|me ta da ta|me ta da ta|me ta da ta|...)

The four 16-bit [half-]words are written like an array, [half-]word 0 at the
lowest address and 3 at the highest. All of them are interpreted as unsigned.

* [0] contains the tag, which can be used as a lookup key in the native-code
  address array, for the Thumb instruction in the first half of the Data Word.
  If there is no such native code, because there has not been a branch to the
  first half in Thumb mode, this is 0000h.
  Legal tags for this [half-]word to represent native code are 0001h to FFFEh.
  FFFFh is not legal due to FFFFh + 1 overflowing an unsigned short.
* [1] contains the tag for the ARM instruction in the Data Word.
  If there is no such native code, because there has not been a branch to the
  word in ARM mode, this is 0000h.
  Legal tags for this word to represent native code are 0001h to FFFEh.
* [2] contains the tag for the Thumb instruction in the second half-word of
  the Data Word.
  If there is no such native code, because there has not been a branch to the
  second half-word in Thumb mode, this is 0000h.
  Legal tags for this [half-]word to represent native code are 0001h to FFFEh.
* [3] contains a code metadata word. It contains 0000h if the Data Word, or
  either half of it, has never been compiled in ARM or Thumb mode for the
  current ROM. Otherwise, it contains:
   15                      3 2 1 0
  [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 A T a t]
                               | |
                               | |
                    Unconditional ARM branch
                    Unconditional Thumb branch
                          Currently ARM
                          Currently Thumb

  The Currently Code flags are set for a Data Word if, despite its tag being
  0, it currently contains an ARM or a Thumb instruction, respectively.
  The Unconditional Branch flags are set for a Data Word if the Data Word
  consists of an unconditional branch in ARM mode, or if the second half of
  the Data Word consists of an unconditional branch in Thumb mode. This is a
  hint that the Partial Flush operation can take, but it is not obligated to
  honour it.
  See the section on Partial Flushes below for more information.

== Tags ==

The "tags" are an index into an array, one per Metadata Area, containing the
addresses of native code blocks in each Data Area. The lookup procedure is as
follows:
1. Obtain an offset into the Data Area. For example, if the GBA address to
   look up is 02F042F8h, then the offset is into 'ewram', and is 42F8h.
2. Mask the lower 2 bits of the offset. In assembly, you also need to multiply
   the offset by 2 because each element is 2 bytes long. Then add the starting
   address of the Metadata Area corresponding to the Data Area to form the
   address of the Metadata Entry.
3. If wishing to execute native code for ARM code, the tag is the Metadata
   Entry's [half-]word at [1] (multiplied by 2 in assembly). In Thumb mode,
   the tag is the [half-]word at [Address & 2] (multiplied by 2 in assembly).
4. A separate array, in this example 'ewram_block_ptrs', can be indexed by the
   tag to find the address of compiled code in the right mode (ARM or Thumb)
   for the tag. In C, that will be <data area>_block_ptrs[tag]. In assembly,
   you need to multiply the tag by 4 then add <data area>_block_ptrs.
The lookup is made in constant time.

== Memory writes ==

The process of writing to a Data Area, via DMA or the memory storage functions
of the stub, is thus as follows:
* Perform the write.
* Get the Metadata Entry describing the Data Word to be written into.
* If [3] & 1 == 1, trigger a Partial Flush targetting the Data Word.

After a Partial Flush, the stub needs to ensure that it is returning to native
code that matches the GBA code at the next GBA instruction. It does that by
looking up the MIPS address of the next GBA instruction using block_lookup_
address_{arm | thumb}.

== Compilation ==

Compilation is also slightly modified:
* Tags run from 0001h to FFFEh. Master gpSP allows tags from 0101h to FFFEh.
  If the current tag, before being incremented, is FFFFh, a Full Flush is
  forced, and its cause will be "Last Tag".
* Compilation shall set the Metadata Entry of any Data Word it newly compiles:
  It shall set [3]'s Currently Code bits (bit 0 and bit 1) for a Data Word it
  compiles wholly in ARM mode (bit 1) or wholly or partially in Thumb mode
  (bit 0).
  It shall set [3]'s Unconditional Branch bits (bit 2 and bit 3) for a Data
  Word if it is an ARM unconditional branch (bit 3) or if its second half-word
  is a Thumb unconditional branch (bit 2).

== Partial Flushes ==

All of this to finally define a Partial Flush targetting a certain Data Word:
* Load the GBA address of the Data Word into the first parameter register for
  the platform.
* Make a call to partial_flush_ram.
  partial_flush_ram is a C function that will take care of the Partial Flush.
* Start with the Metadata Entry for the specified Data Word. Make it not code
  anymore, by setting [0..2] -> 0000h, and by clearing the Currently Code and
  Unconditional Branch bits (bits 0-3) of [3].
* Going to the left (and wrapping to the right if the memory is mirrored),
  clear Metadata Entries for any Data Word, stopping at (but NOT clearing; see
  below) any Metadata Entry whose Data Word:
  a) is not code in any mode ([3] & 3 == 0); or
  b) is an unconditional branch in all of the modes (ARM and Thumb) for which
     it is code ([3] & 3 == [3] & 12).
  The search stops at an unconditional branch but doesn't clear it, because
  that branch is part of the still-valid block to the left of the Data Word
  around which code is being flushed.
* Going to the right (and wrapping to the left if the memory is mirrored),
  clear Metadata Entries for any Data Word, stopping at any Metadata Entry
  whose Data Word:
  a) is not code in any mode ([3] & 3 == 0), in which case don't clear it; or
  b) is an unconditional branch in all of the modes (ARM and Thumb) for which
     it is code ([3] & 3 == [3] & 12), in which case clear it.
  The search stops at an unconditional branch and clears it, because that
  branch is part of the now-invalid block to which the Data Word belongs.

  This will flush all native code that is a subset of the block which is
  being flushed:

  [Start: MOV|SUBS|CMP|...|BEQ|SUB|B Start] <- Flushing this
                              [SUB|B Start] <- will also clear this

  Since blocks in writable areas are ended at the first unconditional branch,
  all surrounding blocks are either:
  a) Subsets that will end at that same branch;
  b) Supersets that will end at that same branch:
     {A: ? ? ?}     [SUBS|CMP|...|BEQ A|B Elsewhere] <- Flushing this
     [A: MOV|LDR|MOV|SUBS|CMP|...|BEQ A|B Elsewhere] <- will also clear this
  c) Blocks that will end at an unconditional branch earlier than the block
     to be flushed, the next instruction being in a block that will end at
     that same branch:
     [B Elsewhere][Start: LDR|MOV|...|B Start]  <- Flushing the LDR
     [B Elsewhere] - - - - - - - - - - - - -    <- does not clear before it

* Return. The return address will be after the instruction that triggered the
  Partial Flush, which is responsible for looking up the native code address
  of the following instruction. This will cause recompilation if the next
  instruction is among those flushed, which may perform a Full Flush, whose
  cause is either "Last tag" or "Cache full", then a branch will be made to
  the new code.

The next instruction may be a subset of a larger block, which will be
recompiled separately. For example:

  {Start: ? ? ?}              [SUB|B Start] <- Flushed this, PC is at SUB
  [Start: MOV|SUBS|CMP|...|BEQ|SUB|B Start] <- Start not yet compiled

This creates a few subset blocks, which should be small enough not to affect
the Translation Cache in any meaningful way. I posit (without any proof, ha!)
that attempting to split or join these subset blocks would cause more
processing than simply recompiling the larger block and letting the smaller
one (and its 1 tag, out of 65534 available) go unused.

In order to cause fewer Full Flushes whose cause is "Cache full", the
Translation Cache needs to be made larger on all platforms. Full Flushes are
unavoidable, but infrequent ones are comparable to Full GCs in garbage-
collected runtime systems like Java[TM].

== Appendix A: Full Flush Causes ==

Full Flushes can be caused by one of 6 events, which dictate how the flush
should be handled.
a) Emulator initialisation. These flushes should be as thorough as possible,
   because the memory of all Metadata Areas is uninitialised. Memsetting is
   appropriate here.
b) ROM loading. These flushes should be thorough, but not as much as during
   emulator initialisation. All Metadata Areas are affected. Specifically:
   * The flushes are allowed to short-cut clearing Metadata Entries if there
     has been code only in part of a Data Area (for example, the start, the
     middle, or the end) before the ROM change.
c) Native code linking. Since read-only areas are expected not to need to be
   compiled often, a high level of optimisation can go into compiling them.
   Branches into a read-only area can therefore be patched directly into a
   native code address, bypassing the lookup mechanism.
   Unfortunately:
   * The BIOS has an unconditional branch into the ROM when it does Reset or
     SoftReset.
   * The ROM has many unconditional branches into the BIOS, in the form of the
     SWI instruction. (At least, most ROMs do; some don't use the BIOS!)
   * The RAM areas can have branches into read-only areas, which are then
     patched.
   So when a read-only area is the target of a Full Flush (with the reason
   "Cache full", below), any native code branches targetting that area have
   become invalid. This affects all other areas than the one flushed.
   These flushes should be less thorough than when loading a ROM.
   Specifically:
   * The flushes are allowed to short-cut clearing Metadata Entries if there
     has been code only in part of a Data Area (for example, the start, the
     middle, or the end).
d) Cache full. These flushes affect only one Metadata Area, and are exactly
   as thorough as the "Native code linking" flushes. If the one Metadata Area
   that is affected describes a read-only area, then all other areas must be
   flushed with the reason "Native code linking".
e) Last tag. If a Metadata Area that uses tags would be the recipient of a
   newly-compiled block with the tag FFFFh, then the affected Metadata Area
   must be flushed before the tag 0001h is usable for the block instead.
   Since the BIOS has a Metadata Area that uses tags, if the BIOS code cache
   is flushed, all others must be flushed with the reason "Native code
   linking".
f) Loading a state. This only needs to affect the RAM areas, even if the
   Program Counter is in the ROM area after loading the state and the code
   is not compiled at that location. (Compiling that code may or may not cause
   a Full Flush of the ROM metadata with the reason "Cache full".)
   Even if the entire RAM has been overwritten after loading a state, the
   Metadata Entries can still be selectively cleared if it was known a priori
   that not all of a Data Area contained code.
